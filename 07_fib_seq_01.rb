# A slightly different kind of challenge this morning.

# The Company has broken the keyboard on their one and only laptop, so canâ€™t get this bit of code to run. What would the output of this code be (without running it on your own computer)? 

  #def fib_seq(num)
   #if num < 2
      #return [num]
   #else
      #fib_seq(num-1) + fib_seq(num-2)
   #end
 #end
 #puts fib_seq(4)

 def divide (dividend,divisor)
    quotient = dividend/divisor)
 end
